Bitcoin was initially proposed by one Satoshi Nakamoto his seminal 2008 white paper titled “Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” Our objective is to develop a decentralized wallet for creating, storing, and recovering blockchain transactions using various decentralization technologies and mnemonic devices.
